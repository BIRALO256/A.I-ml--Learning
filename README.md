    # Flight Delay Prediction - Machine Learning Project

    ## Overview

    This repository is part of my journey into Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). As a beginner in the field, this project is dedicated to learning and applying ML techniques to real-world data. The goal is to predict flight delays using historical flight data, including features like weather conditions, flight schedules, and historical performance.

    This project is a **work in progress** and is intended to help me build a solid understanding of the machine learning process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

    ## Dataset

    The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle, and it contains flight-related data such as:

    - Flight IDs
    - Departure and arrival times
    - Delay times (if any)
    - Weather conditions
    - Airport details
    - Other relevant features

    I will begin by exploring and preprocessing the dataset, followed by applying machine learning algorithms to predict flight delays.

    ## Current Status

    - Initial repository setup.
    - Exploring the dataset and preparing for data preprocessing.
    - Setting up the environment for data analysis and ML.

    ## Learning Goals

    - Explore and understand the Kaggle flight dataset.
    - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
    - Build basic machine learning models for flight delay prediction.
    - Learn to evaluate and optimize machine learning models.
    - Improve understanding of key ML concepts like feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation.

    ## Technologies Used

    - Python
    - Jupyter Notebooks (for analysis and modeling)
    - pandas (for data manipulation)
    - scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
    - Kaggle (for dataset)
    - matplotlib / seaborn (for data visualization)

    ## Next Steps

    - Load and inspect the dataset.
    - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
    - Start building initial machine learning models.
    - Evaluate model performance and begin improving predictions.
